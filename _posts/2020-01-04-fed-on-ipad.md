At the end of last year, I made the crazy choice to switch to an iPad Pro from a MacBook Pro as my personal computer. I've been using a [reMarkable]({% post_url 2017-12-02-my-first-month-or-so-with-my-remarkable.md %}) for over 2 years for sketching and note taking, so that's one of it's primary functions for me. I also wanted to be able to post updates to my site and make design changes, so I began an interesting research journey.

## Version control

Since I'm using Github Pages to serve up my site, I needed a way to easily manage git on my iPad. There's a number of options available on the App Store, but I decided on [Working Copy](https://workingcopy.app/). The ability to clone a repo to my iPad and then push to the remote source we're pretty important, so I opted for the paid version. It's less than $20, and well worth it. 

To be honest, I found the methods of branching, pulling, and fetching in Working Copy to be utterly confusing after using Github's tools for many years â€“ however, an update released *today* has made vast improvements to the UX.
