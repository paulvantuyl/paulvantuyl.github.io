At the end of last year, I made the ca-razy choice to switch from a MacBook Pro to an iPad Pro as my personal computer. I've been using a [reMarkable]({% post_url 2017-12-02-my-first-month-or-so-with-my-remarkable.md %}) for over 2 years for sketching and note taking, so that's one of my iPad's primary uses. However, I also wanted to be able to post updates to my site and make design changes, so I began an interesting research journey.

## Version control

Since I'm using Github Pages to serve up my site, I needed a way to easily manage git on my iPad. There's a number of options available on the App Store, but I decided on [Working Copy](https://workingcopy.app/). The ability to clone a repo to my iPad and then push to the remote source was pretty important, so I opted for the paid version. When I purchased, It was priced at $10; for that price the sheer quantity of feature made the purchase an easy decision. I believe that it's currently priced at $15 USD, which is still a very good value.

Initially I found the methods of branching, pulling, and fetching in Working Copy to be utterly confusing after using Github's tools for many years. Yesterday, however, an update was released that has made vast improvements to the UX.

## Compiling Jekyll and SASS

The harder issue to solve was compiling code on my iPad. Apple still isn't allowing for code compiling on their flagship tablet and iPadOS yet (I'm hoping that changes this year), so I started searching for cloud solutions. The problem I kept finding was that nobody wants to support Safari; it really is the modern IE, but since it has crap market share, nobody cares. Installing Chrome doesn't get me anywhere, because it's still a WebKit browser on iPadOS. 

I ended up getting Google's Cloud Console and Cloud Shell to do what I needed, from Safari â€“ but it did take a little work. Cloud Console does offer a really nice iPad app, but it's missing a couple of key features that the browser console has:

- The ability to run a web server on a port you specify
- Cloud Console can switch between a shell and a file browser, or split screen both; browser can show hidden files
