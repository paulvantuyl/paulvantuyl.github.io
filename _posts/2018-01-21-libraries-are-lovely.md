I've always enjoyed libraries. The smells. The hush. The memories of my mom dragging me through one in particular, wondering about the mystery section, and why she loved books with skulls on them so much. Now I've got a weird nostalgic feeling about them, mixed with this strange yearning for the possibilities of the future and how books don't need to take up so much space.

But a properly designed, well printed book is so _satisfying_.
