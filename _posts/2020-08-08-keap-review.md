I started working at Keap (then branded Infusionsoft) in 2018, and we were in the midst of a massive effort to make products that were easier to use. People didn’t pull punches when letting us know that Infusionsoft was hard to use. They even had colorful nicknames!

While I am starting to our efforts come together, it’s a lot of fun to see this kind of recognition. I’m part of the product design team, and our core focus is our user’s experience; but this kind of effort takes an entire company to pull off. Leadership, marketing, support, sales, coaching, engineering, research… It’s pretty cool.
