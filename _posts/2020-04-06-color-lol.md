Gloriously simple, with excessively descriptive color names. I love it. Site is by [Adam Fuhrer](https://adamfuhrer.com), and he's pulling the data from the [@colorschemez](https://twitter.com/colorschemez) account.

Also, how did I miss the launch of .lol domains? I feel like I lost out on some prime real estate.
