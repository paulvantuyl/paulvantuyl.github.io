Ok, so I must admit I'm a huge Apple nerd and at least try and watch the WWDC Keynote each year, or follow along on a liveblog (usually Engadget). When I found out recently that Webkit has support for [dark mode](https://webkit.org/blog/8840/dark-mode-support-in-webkit/), and that iOS is rumored to have a dark mode like macOS, I just _had_ to make a dark mode theme for my site before WWDC this week.

On a mac, you should be able to switch between Light and Dark appearance on Safari, and have my site's appearance switch back and forth accordingly.
