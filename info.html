		<h3 class="post-tags">TL;DR</h3>
		<p>Hi, my name's Paul Van Tuyl. In case you're wondering, it's pronounced <em>Van Tile</em>. I'm a huge nerd who loves designing applications (mobile or SaaS). A few fun facts:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>My wife and I have kids, and try and help kids in the foster care system</li>
			<li>We have two large-ish chihuahuas (they're like giant squirrels)</li>
			<li>I work full-time as a Principal Product Designer at <a href="https://keap.com/about" title="Keap">Keap</a> in Chandler, AZ</li>
			<li>I'm a gamer, but a lame console gamer. Catch me on my XBone <i class="far fa-gamepad"></i></li>
		</ul>

		<h3>My personal mission statement</h3>

		<p><em>My professional goal is to use my curiosity, love for design, and craftsmanship to create products, processes, and objects that improve quality of life for human beings.</em></p>

		<h2>Résumé <small><a href="/assets/files/paulvantuyl-resume-171125.pdf" class="iconlink"><i class="far fa-file-pdf"></i></a></small></h2>

		<p>I've been working as a designer full time since 2006. While my education was in graphic design for print, the majority of my experience has been in digital formats. I fell in love with the web while in school, and come from the era (and a place) where you had to be able to both design and develop your work.</p>

		<p>I think that design isn't just how things look. It's how it works, looks, and makes you feel.</p>

				<p>As a Principal Designer at Keap, I help lead design solutioning/sprints and work with PMs, Engineers, and other designers to concept and develop end-to-end desktop and mobile-responsive experiences that deliver on customer and business outcomes; validate design using customer research and leverage analytics to make data-informed decisions; and work to champion and improve our design system while inspiring and mentoring other designers.</p>

				<p>As a Design Team Lead at Tallwave, I helped guide efforts to implement design thinking as we created business solutions and opportunities – through well-crafted experiences, products, and services – for Tallwave's clients. I worked directly with clients to help define strategy and requirements for projects and direct team members how to execute against specific business outcomes effectively and efficiently.</p>
				<p>Within the Design Team at Tallwave, my role extended into several areas. Repeatable and effective design process is important at Tallwave, so I worked on ways that we could improve our workflows, methods, and production pipelines. Design Team Leads were also responsible for reviewing work and providing feedback, mentoring team members, scoping projects, and trying to unlock creative potential.<br>
